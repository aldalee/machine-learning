The Biggest Stadiums in the World
People have been pouring into stadiums since the days of ancient Greece In around 80 D, the Romans built the Colosseum, which remains the world’s best known stadium and continues to inform contemporary design Rome’s Colosseum was 157 feet tall and had 80 entrances, seating 50,000 people However, that was small fry compared with the city’s Circus Maximus, which accommodated around 250,000 people
These days, safety regulations-not to mention the modern sports fan’s desire for a good view and comfortable seat—tend to keep stadium capacities（容量） slightly lower Even soccer fans tend to have a seat each; gone are the days of thousands standing to watch the match 
For the biggest stadiums in the world, we have used data supplied by the World Atlas list so far, which ranks them by their stated permanent capacity, as well as updated information from official stadium websites 
All these stadiums are still funtiona1, still open and still hosting the biggest events in world sport

When almost everyone has a mobile phone, why are more than half of Australian homes still paying for a landline（座机）?
These days you’d be hard pressed to find anyone in Australia over the age of 15 who doesn’t own a mobile phone In fact plenty of younger kids have one in their pocket Practically everyone can make and receive calls anywhere, anytime 
Still, 55 percent of Australians have a landline phone at home and only just over a quarter （29%） rely only on their smartphones according to a survey （调查） Of those Australians who still have a landline, a third concede that it’s not really necessary and they’re keeping it as a security blanket — 19 percent say they never use it while a further 13 percent keep it in case of emergencies I think my home falls into that category 
More than half of Australian homes are still choosing to stick with their home phone Age is naturally a factor（因素）— only 58 percent of Generation Ys still use landlines now and then, compared to 84 percent of Baby Boomers who’ve perhaps had the same home number for 50 years Age isn’t the only factor; I’d say it’s also to do with the makeup of your household 
Generation Xers with young families, like my wife and I, can still find it convenient to have a home phone rather than providing a mobile phone for every family member That said, to be honest the only people who ever ring our home phone are our Baby Boomers parents, to the point where we play a game and guess who is calling before we pick up the phone（using Caller ID would take the fun out of it） 
How attached are you to your landline? How long until they go the way of gas street lamps and morning milk deliveries?
24 What does paragraph 2 mainly tell us about mobile phones?
 Their target users 			 Their wide popularity
 Their major functions 		D Their complex design 
25 What does the underlined word “concede” in paragraph 3 mean?
 Admit 		 Argue 		
 Remember 		D Remark 
26 What can we say about Baby Boomers?
 They like smartphone games 	 They enjoy guessing callers’ identity
 They keep using landline phones 	D They are attached to their family 
27 What can be inferred about the landline from the last paragraph?
 It remains a family necessity 
 It will fall out of use some day 
 It may increase daily expenses 
D It is as important as the gas light 
You’ve heard that plastic is polluting the oceans — between 48 and 127 million tonnes enter ocean ecosystems every year But does one plastic straw or cup really make a difference? Artist Benjamin Von Wong wants you to know that it does He builds massive sculptures out of plastic garbage, forcing viewers to re-examine their relationship to single-use plastic products 
At the beginning of the year, the artist built a piece called “Strawpocalypse,” a pair of 10-foot-tall plastic waves, frozen mid-crash Made of 168,000 plastic straws collected from several volunteer beach cleanups, the sculpture made its first appearance at the Estella Place shopping center in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 
Just 9% of global plastic waste is recycled Plastic straws are by no means the biggest source（来源）of plastic pollution, but they’ve recently come under fire because most people don’t need them to drink with and, because of their small size and weight, they cannot be recycled Every straw that’s part of Von Wong’s artwork likely came from a drink that someone used for only a few minutes Once the drink is gone, the straw will take centuries to disappear 
In a piece from 2018, Von Wong wanted to illustrate（说明） a specific statistic: Every 60 seconds, a truckload’s worth of plastic enters the ocean For this work, titled “Truckload of Plastic,” Von Wong and a group of volunteers collected more than 10,000 pieces of plastic, which were then tied together to look like they’d been dumped（倾倒） from a truck all at once 
Von Wong hopes that his work will also help pressure big companies to reduce their plastic footprint 
28 What are Von Wong’s artworks intended for?
 Beautifying the city he lives in 		 Introducing eco-friendly products 
 Drawing public attention to plastic waste 	D Reducing garbage on the beach 
29 Why does the author discuss plastic straws in paragraph 3?
 To show the difficulty of their recycling 
 To explain why they are useful 
 To voice his views on modern art 
D To find a substitute for them 
30 What effect would “Truckload of Plastic” have on viewers?
 Calming 			 Disturbing 	
 Refreshing 			D Challenging 
31 Which of the following can be the best title for the text?
 Artists’ Opinions on Plastic Safety
 Media Interest in Contemporary Art
 Responsibility Demanded of Big Companies
D Ocean Plastics Transformed into Sculptures
During an interview for one of my books, my interviewer said something I still think about often Annoyed by the level of distraction（干扰）in his open office, he said, “That’s why I have a membership at the coworking space across the street — so I can focus” His comment struck me as strange After all, coworking spaces also typically use an open office layout（布局） But I recently came across a study that shows why his approach works 
The researchers examined various levels of noise on participants as they completed tests of creative thinking They were randomly divided into four groups and exposed to various noise levels in the background, from total silence to 50 decibels（分贝）, 70 decibels, and 85 decibels The differences between most of the groups were statistically insignificant; however, the participants in the 70 decibels group — those exposed to a level of noise similar to background chatter in a coffee shop — significantly outperformed the other groups Since the effects were small, this may suggest that our creative thinking does not differ that much in response to total silence and 85 decibels of background noise 
But since the results at 70 decibels were significant, the study also suggests that the right level of background noise — not too loud and not total silence — may actually improve one’s creative thinking ability The right level of background noise may interrupt our normal patterns of thinking just enough to allow our imaginations to wander, without making it impossible to focus This kind of “distracted focus” appears to be the best state for working on creative tasks 
So why do so many of us hate our open offices? The problem may be that, in our offices, we can’t stop ourselves from getting drawn into others’ conversations while we’re trying to focus Indeed, the researchers found that face-to-face interactions and conversations affect the creative process, and yet a coworking space or a coffee shop provides a certain level of noise while also providing freedom from interruptions 
32 Why does the interviewer prefer a coworking space?
 It helps him concentrate 		 It blocks out background noise 
 It has a pleasant atmosphere 		D It encourages face-to-face interactions 
33 Which level of background noise may promote creative thinking ability?
 Total silence 	 50 decibels 	 70 decibels 	D 8 5 decibels 
34 What makes an open office unwelcome to many people?
 Personal privacy unprotected 		 Limited working space 
 Restrictions on group discussion 		D Constant interruptions 
35 What can we infer about the author from the text?
 He’s a news reporter 
 He’s an office manager 
 He’s a professional designer 
D He’s a published writer 
According to Jessica Hagy, author of How to Be Interesting, it’s not difficult to make yourself interesting at a dinner party 
  36  , if you’re out of your comfort zone or if you’re wandering into somebody’s house for the first time So the main thing is just to show up and be adventurous, trying different foods and talking to strangers 
People love to talk about themselves If you can start the conversation with a question other than “What do you do for a living?”, you’ll be able to get a lot more interesting conversation out of whomever it is you’re talking to   37  , it can bring in “I have this old, broken-down vehicle” or “I rode the bus with these crazy people who were laughing at silly jokes in the back” It just opens up conversation 
  38  ? If you can’t take their wine away, you should certainly try to take away their soapbox （讲台） If you’re the host, you can ask them to help you in the kitchen with something and just remove them from the situation  39  
And what about that other dinner-party killer: awkward silence? If you’re faced with an awkward silence at a dinner party, the only thing that always gets everyone talking again is to give the host a compliment（赞扬） _ 40   Just quickly turn around and say, “This cake is extremely delicious and you have to tell me all about it”
So being interesting at a dinner party isn’t that hard 
 How do you know the host
 The first step is to go exploring
 If you ask the question “How did you get here?”
D Be prepared to have awkward conversations with strangers
E Or turn the conversation into a topic where they have little to say
F What about that person who had too much to drink or won’t stop talking
G He or she is the person who is feeling the weight of that awkwardness the most
Simply saying thank you doesn’t seem enough in certain situations I was considering this while working as a  41   just a few weeks ago And it came to me then how much easier it would be if we had a range of words that express different   42   of gratitude（感谢） 
My thoughts were soon   43   We had a woman patient who was   44   from a knee replacement operation One afternoon, while   45   to get into bed she collapsed（倒下） from what was   46_  discovered to be a heart attack The collapse was disastrous,   47  the emergency medical team and good teamwork But she recovered, though   48 _, and was ready for discharge（出院）after four weeks 
She was   49   for everything that the medical and nursing team had done for her On her day of discharge, we shared in her   50   at her recovery As she was   51   she was eager to say   52   to each of us in the nursing team When she   53   one nurse, she tried to press a five-pound note into her hand My colleague   54   to accept it, saying that we were all just   55   our job The patient looked puzzled, and then   56  : “Oh this isn’t for the  _57__ I had I take that as a   58   No, this is for setting my hair yesterday”
And there you have it To many people,   59   lives is part of the job styling hair is an   60   and should be rewarded

Ecotourism is commonly regarded as low impact travel to undisturbed places It is different from traditional tourism because it allows the traveler to become   61   （educate）about the areas — both in terms of geographical conditions and cultural characteristics, and often provides money for conservation and benefits the   62  （develop） of the local areas 
Ecotourism has   63   （it） origin with the environmental movement of the 1970s It was not widely accepted as a travel concept   64   the late 1980s During that time, increasing environmental awareness made it desirable 
Due to   65   growing popularity of environmentally-related and adventure travel, various types   66   trips are now being classified as ecotourism Actually, a true eco-friendly trip must meet the following principles:
Minimize the impact of   67  （visit） the place 
Build respect for and awareness of the environment and cultural practices 
Provide   68  （finance） aid and other benefits for local peoples 
Make sure that the tourism provides experiences for both the visitors and the hosts
Komodo National Park, officially recognized in 1980, is popular for ecotourism because of its unique biodiversity   69  （activity） there range from whale watching to hiking （远足） and accommodations aim  70  （have） a low impact on the natural environment 
I love doing housework I always assist my parents in doing the dish after meals I also water the flowers in the yard and tidying up my own bedroom whatever necessary In my opinion, students can benefit a lot doing some housework Firstly, doing housework was helpful for us to be a responsible person Also, it gives our parents more time to do what they are like and it improves the family relationship What’s most, doing housework can be a form of mentally relaxation from study That’s our view on housework And hopes this can inspire more thinking on the topic!
